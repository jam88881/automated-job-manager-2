### Setup for Debugging and Development

1. In a VSCode terminal (within the root of the project folder), create the virtual environment:

   python3 -m venv env  (mac / linux)
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment. Your command prompt should now be prefixed with (env):

   .\env\Scripts\activate.bat  (windows)

   source env/bin/activate  (mac / linux)
   ```
3. Install Python requirements:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt   (windows)
